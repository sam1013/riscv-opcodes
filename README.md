riscv-opcodes
===========================================================================

This is a subproject of [TIMBER-V Toolchain][timberv-riscv-tools].

This repo enumerates standard RISC-V instruction opcodes and control and
status registers.  It also contains a script to convert them into several
formats (C, Scala, LaTeX).

This repo is not meant to stand alone; it is a subcomponent of
[timberv-riscv-tools] and assumes that it
is part of that directory structure.
